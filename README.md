### shadow.ga "shop" for 1.10 servers
A [Spigot](https://www.spigotmc.org/wiki/spigot-installation/) plugin made for shop management on freedom or anarchy servers.

This plugin was originally created for the [Aedificium](https://aedi.app) server.  Credit to [Lemon](https://github.com/OxLemonxO).

Requires Java 7 or newer, [Aero](https://github.com/Pravian/Aero), and depends on [Votifier](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/votifier) for 1.9 (which works with 1.10).  Made to work with [TotalFreedomMod](https://github.com/totalfreedom/totalfreedommod).
